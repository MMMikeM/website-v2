## Overview

Rhum is a test double module that helps facilitate your testing needs. It helps
you with both state verification and behavior verification. Some examples of how
Rhum can help you:

- Assert that a certain method on a class was called a number of times
- Override methods or properties on classes during test runs
- Ensure business logic was not called in a user flow
- Faking responses from databases, APIs, services, and more

The above list is not finite. There are many more use cases for Rhum. It really
depends on your testing needs.
